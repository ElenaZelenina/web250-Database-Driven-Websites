                <h2>WEB 250-85 Course Contract</h2>
                <p>I, <a href="http://students.cpcc.edu/~ezeleni0/web250/introduction.html">Elena Zelenina</a>, agree to abide
                    by the terms of the course contract in my <b>Spring 2020, WEB 250-85, Database Driven Websites</b> with my instructor, <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WduqbeCUM3Dggq7IAlcOFP0rnundjW1iOj78XrEnMEs/pub?output=html">D.I.
                        von Briesen</a>.</p>
                <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to
                    the
                    world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to
                    keep
                    private.</p>
                <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
                    As such,
                    failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
                <p>Signed: Elena Zelenina, January 17th, 2020.</p>
