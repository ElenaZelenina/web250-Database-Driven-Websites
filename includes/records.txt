Princess Bean||bean.jpg||<p><b>Princess Tiabeanie Mariabeanie de la Rochambeaux Grunkwitz</b>, better known as <b>Bean</b>, is the main character of Disenchantment. She is the 19-year-old princess of Dreamland and possible heir to the throne of Maru. She is the daughter of King Zog and Dagmar and the older half-sister of the King Derek.</p><p>Bean is a hard drinker and constantly accompanied by her elf friend Elfo, and her "personal demon" Luci.</p><p>Not a traditional princess, Bean is quite the opposite, actively rebelling against her father, Zøg, who has driven her to drink. She is frustrated by the limited life-choices available to her as a princess who is second in line to the throne. She resents the stereotypical role of a trophy Queen - which is to have heirs and forge alliances in a loveless union - and refuses to marry the eligible princes presented to her (Guysbert and Merkimer) which would force her to inhabit this role. Her three wishes are to be in charge of her own destiny, get her mom back (obviously) and to find a boyfriend who is a great listener. She is may seem irresponsible, rebellious and cynical, but is surprisingly 'normal' for a princess.</p>
Elfo||elfo.jpg||<p><b>Elfo</b> is the tritagonist of Disenchantment. He lives in Dreamland, and is Princess Bean's half-elf companion and friend.</p><p>Elfo is voiced by Nat Faxon.</p><p>Elfo begins by being dissatisfied with life in Elfwood. For him, something does not seem quite right. He has had enough of being happy all the time - suffering the elvish equivalent of depression. Making candy all day to get paid in candy just doesn't make sense to him anymore. As such, he is savvy of his own genre and has outgrown his elven tropes. He craved freedom and adventure. To that end, he desires to see the outside world, despite how unscrupulous and miserable it may be.</p>
Luci||luci.png||<p><b>Luci</b> is the deuteragonist in Disenchantment. He lives in Dreamland, is Princess Bean's "personal demon", and is the owner and bartender at Luci's Inferno.</p><p>He is voiced by Eric Andre.</p><p>Throughout the first season, Luci's nature is apparently of the traditional demon: he is pure evil and not capable of love or compassion, and acts as a puppet for Cloyd and Becky in their plot. Luci's role is to guide Bean towards her destiny which he does by generally encouraging her towards mischief and leading her astray. His actions are usually subtle, sometimes seemingly trivial and often significantly advance the plot. It is unclear whether he knows precisely in what way to guide Bean, but it is clear that he expresses no personal agenda throughout season 1.</p>
Queen Dagmar||dagmar.jpg||<p>Queen <b>Dagmar</b> is the Queen of Maru, the ex-wife of the King Zøg and the mother of the Princess Bean.</p><p>Dagmar spends most of the first season as a stone statue into which she was turned 15 years earlier after ingesting a poison. She is reanimated towards the end of the seasn, when we discover her true identity as a Maruvian princess.</p>
King Zøg||zog.jpg||<p>King <b>Zøg Grunkwitz</b> is a major character of Disenchantment. He is the unscrupulous father of Bean and King Derek and the previous dethroned ruler of Dreamland. He is voiced by John DiMaggio.</p><p>He was accidentally shot by Bean in the Electric Princess after Bean scuffling with the Captain Guard to keep the Dragon Whistle Revolver.</p>
Queen Oona||oona.jpg||<p>Queen <b>Oona</b> is a character in Disenchantment. She is the second ex-wife of the King Zøg, the mother of the King Derek, and the stepmother of the Princess Tiabeanie. Oona is a Dankmirian, and a member of Dankmire's royal family.</p><p>After the fall of Dreamland, she divorced King Zøg and became a pirate, becoming the infamous <b>Pirate Queen</b>.</p>
Odval||odval.jpg||<p><b>Odval</b> is a recurring character and one of the primary antagonist in Disenchantment. He is prime minster of Dreamland and is serving as regent until King Derek come is of age. He was the top royal advisor and 'Hand' to King Zog, a member of the Royal Council, and one of the leaders of the secret society known as the Seekers. Sorcerio is his friend and lover. He is voiced by Maurice LaMarche.</p><p>After Bean accidentally shot Zog, he tried to have Bean, Elfo and Lucci burned in the stake so he can control Derek behind the scene as a puppet king. Unfortunately, Bean, Elfo and Lucci are saved by Dagmar after she created the escaped hole underneath the burning stake to save them.</p>
King Derek||derek.jpg||<p><b>King Derek Grunkwitz of Dreamland</b> is the son of King Zøg and Queen Oona, and younger half-brother of Princess Bean. He is the youngest child of Zøg and his only son, so was the Crown Prince and heir apparent to the Throne of Dreamland, but has now been crowned king after Zøg's physical inability to rule. However, he is actually a puppet king under the thumb of his adviser Odval.</p>
Old Man Touchy||old_man_touchy.png||<p><b>Old Man Touchy</b> is a prisoner held in the dungeon beneath the Dreamland Castle. He's a strange, perverted old man who had a habit of touching anyone or anything, as his power is to identify things he's touched. He presumably groped or molested the wrong person, which led to King Zøg having him thrown into the dungeon and getting both of his eyes gouged out. However, he appears as a kind and fun man, comforting King Zog in a later scene.</p><p>His (currently) only appearance is in To Thine Own Elf Be True, where King Zog uses him to find the truth of the Eternity Pendant. He reveals that the pendant is real, but that Elfo is the one needing examination - remarking that he is "not an elf, but also not not-an-elf" and that he hasn't touched anything like him.</p>
Sorcerio||sorcerio.jpg||<p><b>Sorcerio</b> is a wizard who served as an adviser to King Zøg of Dreamland in his castle, and now serves as an adviser to King Derek. He is a member of the Seekers secret society, and is the friend and a lover of Odval.</p><p>Sorcerio's role is that of polymathic researcher, whose expertise is primarily in the sciences, including the scientific study of magic and (magical) alchemy (also known as the occult sciences). Sorcerio is extremely knowledgeable about occult science/magical research, and tries his best to do research and improve his mediocre practical skills.</p>
